    <h1>Welcome to the Archive!</h1>
    <p>Hey! Welcome to the archive! What you are about to see is a directory tree. Basically, you will see everything in the archive. Then you will see lines leading down. Those represent "/". Lets say it was the images folder. First of all, you need to link to a direct file. so it would be something like /images/id_icon_gradiant_more2.png because the lines pointed to images and then the id icon. Enjoy! /README.txt would be the readme.</p>
