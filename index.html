      <h1>Welcome to RandomNet V2</h1>
      <p>This is Randomosity! This is the RandomNet revamp (previously RandomNet V2), which should be better than RandomNet. You can still go to <a href="/randomnetv1/index.html">the original</a>.</p>
      <button onclick="alert('YOU CLICKED IT'); window.close();">dont click this button</button>
      <p>RandomNet's links have been very buggy since the move, so I will just put the directory tree <a href="tree.html">here</a>. This is NOT the full tree, it only includes stuff like the RandomNet archive.</p>
      <h2>Here is the "useful" part</h2>
      <p>We have tools! Yes, tools!</p>
      <p><b>web</b> tools.</p>
      <p>But before we get to that, here is some quick links for you. Nevermind, I lost those.</p>
      <div class="footer">Randomosity 2023 (Formerly RandomNet V2)</div>
