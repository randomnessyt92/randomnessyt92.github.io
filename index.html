      <h1>Welcome to RandomNet V2</h1>
      <p>This is RandomNet V2! This is the second version of RandomNet, which should be better than the last one. You can still go to <a href="/randomnetv1/index.html">V1</a>.</p>
      <button onclick="alert('YOU CLICKED IT'); window.close();">dont click this button</button>
      <p>V1's links have been very buggy since the move, so I will just put the directory tree here.</p>
