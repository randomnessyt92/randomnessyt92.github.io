      <h1>Welcome to RandomNet V2</h1>
      <p>This is RandomNet V2! This is the second version of RandomNet, which should be better than the last one. You can still go to <a href="/randomnetv1/index.html">V1</a>.</p>
      <button onclick="alert('YOU CLICKED IT'); window.close();">dont click this button</button>
      <p>V1's links have been very buggy since the move, so I will just put the directory tree <a href="tree.html">here</a>. This is NOT the full tree, it only includes stuff like the V1 archive.</p>
      <h2>Here is the "useful" part</h2>
      <p>We have tools! Yes, tools!</p>
      <p><b>web</b> tools.</p>
      <p>But before we get to that, here is some quick links for you. Nevermind, I lost those.</p>
      <div class="footer">RandomNet 2023</div>
